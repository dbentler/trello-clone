# Trello-Clone with React + React Redux
In order to hone my skills with the React.js framework, I decided to learn how to builld a Trello board
via React and the React Redux frameworks (and material theme).

# Why would you do that?
I like trello. Something is awfully satisfying about being able to move to-do items to their proper place.
As EA once called it: "it gives our [consumers] a sense of 'pride and accomplishment'".

# What have you learned from this project?

JavaScript isn't that scary at all. I LOVE `=>` functions. They're awesome!

Also I was able to hone my JavaScript abilites and apply them more than I did with my personal website. 

# Hey wait a second, this isn't done at all!

I know, I'm still working out the kinks.

# Will you have a publicly available demo for this?

Stay tuned!
