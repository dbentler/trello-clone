# Trello-Clone with React + React Redux (**WIP WIP WIP**)
In order to hone my skills with the React.js framework, I decided to learn how to builld a Trello board
via React and the React Redux frameworks (and material theme).

# Why would you do that?
I like trello. Something is awfully satisfying about being able to move to-do items to their proper place.
As EA once called it: "it gives our [consumers] a sense of 'pride and accomplishment'".

# Hey wait a second, this isn't done at all!

I know, It's still a work in progress.

# Will you have a publicly available demo for this?

Stay tuned!
